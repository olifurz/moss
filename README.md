# Moss
<b>Yet another OS built in [COSMOS](https://github.com/olifurz/Cosmos "COSMOS")</b></br>

## About
Moss is the working name for an operating system I'm working on that is based on the COSMOS framework. It is built completely in C#, programs inside also are currently compiled ahead-of-time from the same language (though Lua support is planned).

The COSMOS repository used is my own fork that currently only implements multithreading support from the corresponding branch. It can be accessed above.

## Features
- [x] Topbar w/ clock
- [x] Bitmap-based font rendering

#### Requirements
- .NET 6.0 Core
- Virtualbox, VMWare or any decent virtual machine software. Or you could run it on actual hardware if you're a psycho.
